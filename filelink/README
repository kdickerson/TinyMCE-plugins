Filelink TinyMCE plugin.

You initialize the plugin with a set of filenames and corresponding URLs.
The user can then create a link to one of the files by clicking the button for this plugin, then clicking the file.

I used this to allow users to upload files and then easily create links to the files they've uploaded in the editor.

Example of initializing the plugin:

Before initializing TinyMCE, create an array of the files you want available:
<script type="text/javascript">
  var available_files = [];
  available_files.push({'name':'file1.txt', 'url':'url_for_this_file'});
  available_files.push({'name':'file2.txt', 'url':'url_for_this_file'});
  available_files.push({'name':'file3.txt', 'url':'url_for_this_file'});
</script>

I accomplish this by looping over my datastructure referencing these files on the server and
  outputting one entry of available_files.push(...) for each file.

Once the array is created we pass it to TinyMCE upon initialization so the plugin can see the data.
Ignoring the normal setup, you'll need to make sure these pieces are correctly in place:
  include the plugin, put the plugin's button in the toolbar, pass in the available files.
<script type="text/javascript">
  tinyMCE.init({
        plugins: "filelink",
        theme_advanced_buttons1: "filelink",
        filelink_available_files:available_files,
    });
</script>
