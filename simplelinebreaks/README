SimpleLineBreaks TinyMCE plugin.

We discovered that users mostly didn't know that they could move to a new line without creating a new paragraph
  by pressing CTRL + ENTER.  So this often resulted in long entries with lots of unnecessary whitespace.
This plugin is simply to help clean that up.  The user, or a moderator, can select the many paragraphs of text and
  click the SimpleLineBreaks button to convert the text into a single paragraph with linebreaks.
It occasionally doesn't do quite what it's supposed to, but it works most of the time.

Example of initializing the plugin:

Ignoring the normal setup, you'll need to make sure these pieces are correctly in place:
  include the plugin, put the plugin's button in the toolbar.
<script type="text/javascript">
  tinyMCE.init({
        plugins: "simplelinebreaks",
        theme_advanced_buttons1: "simplelinebreaks",
    });
</script>
